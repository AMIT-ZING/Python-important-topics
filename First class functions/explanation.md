# First class functions:
In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. 
This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, 
and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.  

We can say that a function in Python is First Class Function, if it supports all of the properties of a First Class object.

## Properties of first class functions:
- A function is an instance of the Object type.
- You can store the function in a variable.
- You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
- You can return the function from a function.
- You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦
